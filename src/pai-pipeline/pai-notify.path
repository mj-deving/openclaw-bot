# pai-notify.path — DEPRECATED
#
# systemd user path units cannot watch /var/lib/ directories due to
# namespace restrictions in user-level systemd instances.
#
# Replaced by pai-result-watcher.py (Python inotify) running as a
# Type=simple service in pai-notify.service.
#
# This file is kept for reference only. Do not install.
